        <h3>This Rigatoni al Segreto recipe was the most closely guarded secret at Gino's, one of New York City's most famous Italian restaurants. 
            When it closed, the recipe got out. But I think the amount of butter was way too low. So here's my version.</h3>
            <div class="lists"><h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                    <li>1 cup diced onion</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste</li>
                    <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed (or more to taste)</li>
                    <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
                    <li>1 (28 ounce) can San Marzano (Italian) tomatoes, blended smooth</li>
                    <li>½ cup water (to rinse out can of tomatoes)</li>
                    <li>1 (8 ounce) package uncooked rigatoni pasta</li>
                    <li>½ cup fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced</li>
                    <li>4 tablespoons cold butter, cubed</li>
                    <li>1 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, plus more for serving</li>
                </ul>
                
    
                <h2>Directions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat olive oil in saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onions, salt. Cook until no longer white and starting to turn translucent, 
                        about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic; cook about 1 minute. Add chili flakes and blended tomato sauce. Bring to a simmer; adjust heat 
                        to medium to medium-low. Simmer gently, stirring occasionally, for 45 to 60 minutes. Reduce heat to low.</li>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet 
                        firm to the bite, about 8 minutes (5 minutes from doneness).</li>
                    <li>Add about 2/3 of the basil to the sauce. Stir in butter. When butter melts, add cheese in 3 increments.</li>
                    <li>Drain pasta; transfer to sauce. Stir until rigatoni are evenly coated with sauce. Serve sprinkled with the remaining basil and 
                        a dusting of grated cheese.</li>
                </ol></div>
